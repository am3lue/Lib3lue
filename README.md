## Running the Application

### Starting the Server

1. Open terminal in the project folder
2. Start the server:
```bash
julia serve.jl
```
3. You'll see:
```
Starting 3lue Library server...
Server running at http://<your-ip-address>:8000
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

4. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://<your-ip-address>:8000
```

Note: Replace `<your-ip-address>` with your device's actual IP address. The server will automatically detect and display your IP address when starting up.

### Accessing from Other Devices

The application is accessible from any device on your local network. To access it:
1. Make sure your device and the accessing device are on the same network
2. Use the IP address shown when starting the server
3. Open a browser on the other device and navigate to:
```
http://<server-ip-address>:8000
```

### Stopping the Server

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
- Wait for the server to stop

### Running in Background

#### Windows
```bash
start /B julia serve.jl
```

#### macOS/Linux
```bash
julia serve.jl &
```

### Troubleshooting Startup

1. **Port 8000 in use?**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# macOS/Linux
lsof -i :8000
```
Solution: Change port in `serve.jl` or stop the process using port 8000

2. **Dependencies missing?**
```bash
julia init.jl
```

3. **Permission issues?**
- Windows: Run as Administrator
- Linux/macOS: Use `sudo`
